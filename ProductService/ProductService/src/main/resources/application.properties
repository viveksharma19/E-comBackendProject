#FakeStoreAPI configurations
fakestore.api.base.url = https://fakestoreapi.com
fakestore.api.product.path = /products
fakestore.api.category.path = /category

#2nd option - why we not use this ? because https://fakestoreapi.com is repeating twice.
#              Here it might not look that big of a deal because it is happening only
#              two times but what if it becomes 10 such items like product, category, order
#              payment, etc. Then would you setup 10 times https://fakestoreapi.com. It
#              is not a good idea. we cannot config in controller class you can put inside
#              a String but not a good idea. in realtime project we are going to follow same approach.
